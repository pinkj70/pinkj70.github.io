<p>Hi Guys! My name is Jamie Harlow! I grew up in a small town, Turner Maine. I was born on January 27,2000.
    I went to Leavitt Area high school and graduated in June of 2018. Throughout school I was the one always
trying out new sports. I was a year round athlete I was a Field hockey player, Cheerleader, and ran track a few years.
    I went into college not having a clue what I wanted to do with my life or even the college I wanted to go to.
    After applying to school after school getting 13 acceptance letters the thought of college got so scary.
    But im glad my parents helped me pick and I couldn't be more happier with my decision. I went to college hoping to
    play field hockey but didn't have that much time to commit so I decided to join the club Field Hockey team,
    and I fell in love with my team immeditely. After going through sorority recuitment and putting myself out there
I have fell in love with Umaine and im excited to be spending my college career up here with all my great friends!</p>
